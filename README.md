# Analysing Disease-Outbreak-in-Nigeria

### Project Overview

This project centers on analyzing trends in disease outbreaks in Nigeria, with a particular focus on emerging and re-emerging diseases such as COVID-19, Mpox, and cholera. The goal is to identify patterns, monitor outbreak dynamics, and generate insights to inform public health strategies. Through data visualization and exploratory analysis, the project aims to deepen understanding of the spread, prevalence, and impact of these diseases over time.

### Data Source  
**NCDC (Nigeria Centre for Disease Control):** The primary data was obtained from the NCDC in PDF format.  

### Tools  
- **Excel:** For data cleaning and extraction.  
- **Power BI:** For data analysis and visualization.  

### Data Cleaning and Preparation  
The following tasks were conducted to prepare the data for analysis:  
1. **Data Loading and Inspection:** Initial examination of the raw data to understand its structure and content.  
2. **Handling Missing Values:** Identifying and appropriately addressing gaps in the dataset.  
3. **Data Cleaning and Formatting:** Ensuring consistency and accuracy in the dataset for seamless analysis.  

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
The EDA focused on uncovering trends in disease outbreaks across Nigeria by addressing critical questions, including:  

- **Number of Deaths:** How many fatalities were caused by these pathogens?  
- **Most Affected States:** Which regions in Nigeria experienced the highest burden of these diseases?  
- **Incidence Peaks:** During which months were outbreak incidences highest?  
- **Age Demographics:** Which age groups were most affected?  
- **Laboratory Performance:** How many laboratories were operational versus non-performing?  
- **Test Types:** What were the different diagnostic test methods used?  
- **Preventive Measures:** Which preventive strategies were most effective, and why were some rejected by the public?  

This structured approach provides actionable insights into outbreak patterns, aiding targeted interventions and improved public health strategies.

### Findings and Insights  

1. **COVID-19 in 2022:**  
   - **Cases:** 530,000 (Jan–Sept).  
   - **Deaths:** 6,000.  
   - **Recoveries:** 515,000 (higher than deaths).  
   - PCR tests were more common than RDTs.  
   - Most public labs couldn’t conduct COVID-19 diagnostics.  

2. **Mpox in 2022:**  
   - Highest outbreak recorded.  
   - Young adults (21–30) were most affected.  
   - June had the most cases.  

3. **Cholera in 2024:**  
   - Lagos State had the highest outbreak rate.  

4. **Vaccination:**  
   - Moderna and Pfizer were the most effective for COVID-19.  
   - Vaccine hesitancy was driven by conspiracy theories.  

### Recommendations  

1. Equip public labs with PCR machines and train scientists in early diagnosis.  
2. Launch campaigns to promote vaccination and debunk myths.  
3. Research causes of high Mpox cases in 2022 and recurring cholera outbreaks.  

### Limitations  
- Insufficient data for multi-year trend analysis.
